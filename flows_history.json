HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION \u2014 CSE-407  \n2. Introduction to Machine Learning \u2014 CSE-472  \n3. MLOps: Engineering AI Systems \u2014 CSE-453  \n4. Business Process Reengineering for Data-Driven Transformation \u2014 MGT-212  \n5. COMPUTER SCIENCE PROJECT I \u2014 CSE-493  \n\nBelow is what you can do, one by one.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Log into UMS and confirm course list\n\nYou\u2019ve already provided credentials, but here\u2019s the minimal sequence:\n\n1. Go to: `https://ums.iba.edu.pk/`\n2. Enter:\n   - ERP ID: `24478`\n   - Password: `Abc@4478`\n3. Click **LOGIN**.\n4. On the **Student Dashboard**, under **Semester: Fall 2025**, note the course titles (the same 5 listed above).\n\nYou only need this step to confirm the list; you don\u2019t need to click into each course for what you asked.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Open YouTube and search for each course\n\nOpen a new tab and go to: `https://www.youtube.com`\n\nThen, for each course below, paste the search query into the YouTube search bar and press Enter, then open a few promising videos in new tabs.\n\n### Course 1: HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION (CSE-407)\n\nUse YouTube search queries like:\n\n- `Human Computer Interaction full course`\n- `Human Computer Interaction IBA BSCS`\n- `HCI course playlist`\n- `Human Computer Interaction lecture series`\n\nOpen videos that:\n- Are full playlists or lecture series\n- Have titles containing \u201cHuman-Computer Interaction\u201d, \u201cHCI\u201d, \u201ccourse\u201d, or \u201clectures\u201d\n\n### Course 2: Introduction to Machine Learning (CSE-472)\n\nSearch:\n\n- `Introduction to Machine Learning full course`\n- `Intro to Machine Learning lecture series`\n- `Machine Learning course for undergraduates`\n- `CSE-472 Introduction to Machine Learning` (in case someone uploaded IBA-specific material)\n\nOpen videos that:\n- Are from reputable channels (e.g., university channels, well-known ML educators)\n- Are playlists covering supervised/unsupervised learning, regression, classification, etc.\n\n### Course 3: MLOps: Engineering AI Systems (CSE-453)\n\nSearch:\n\n- `MLOps full course`\n- `MLOps engineering AI systems`\n- `MLOps tutorial end to end`\n- `MLOps for machine learning engineers`\n\nOpen videos that:\n- Mention \u201cMLOps\u201d, \u201cdeployment\u201d, \u201cCI/CD for ML\u201d, \u201cML pipelines\u201d, \u201cproduction ML\u201d\n- Are structured as a course or multi-part series\n\n### Course 4: Business Process Reengineering for Data-Driven Transformation (MGT-212)\n\nSearch:\n\n- `Business Process Reengineering full course`\n- `BPR business process reengineering lectures`\n- `Data-driven transformation business process`\n- `Business process reengineering and data analytics`\n\nOpen videos that:\n- Include \u201cBusiness Process Reengineering\u201d or \u201cBPR\u201d in the title\n- Talk about process redesign, data-driven decision making, and transformation\n\n### Course 5: COMPUTER SCIENCE PROJECT I (CSE-493)\n\nThis is more generic, so search by what\u2019s most helpful:\n\n- `final year project computer science`\n- `software engineering capstone project`\n- `how to choose a CS final year project`\n- `CS project documentation and presentation`\n\nOpen videos that:\n- Help with project selection, planning, documentation, and presentation\n- Cover project lifecycle, requirements, design, implementation, and reporting\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to \u201copen them up one by one\u201d efficiently\n\nFor each course:\n\n1. Type the relevant search query in YouTube.\n2. From the results:\n   - Ctrl+Click (or Cmd+Click on Mac) on 2\u20133 of the best-looking videos to open them in new tabs.\n3. Repeat for the next course with its own query.\n\nYou\u2019ll end up with:\n- 1 UMS tab (dashboard with course list)\n- 1 YouTube search tab per course\n- Several video tabs per course\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can tell me which course you want to focus on first, and I can suggest specific channels/playlists and a recommended watching order for that course.",

COMPUTER SCIENCE PROJECT I  \n   - Code: CSE-493  \n   - Instructor: Ms Abeera Tariq  \n   - Suggested YouTube searches:  \n     - `Computer Science Project I CSE-493`  \n     - `how to choose final year project computer science`  \n     - `software engineering capstone project guidelines`  \n\nHow to do what you asked, step by step:\n\n1. On your browser, open YouTube (https://www.youtube.com).  \n2. For each course above:\n   - Copy one of the suggested queries.\n   - Paste into the YouTube search bar.\n   - Press Enter.\n   - Open 1\u20133 videos that look like full lecture series or playlists (e.g., titles containing \u201cfull course\u201d, \u201clecture 1\u201d, or \u201cplaylist\u201d).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the titles or links of videos you\u2019re considering for any course, and I can help you decide which ones are most suitable (e.g., by checking coverage, level, and instructor credibility).",

Go to your dashboard and copy the **list of course names** (exact titles as shown, e.g.,  \n   - \u201cFinancial Accounting\u201d  \n   - \u201cProgramming Fundamentals (CS-101)\u201d  \n   - \u201cBusiness Communication\u201d  \n   etc.)\n3. Paste that list here.\n\nOnce you paste the course list, I will:\n\n- For each course name:\n  - Construct a YouTube query like:  \n    `\"<course name> IBA lecture\"`, `\"<course name> full course\"`, or similar.\n  - Give you:\n    - A direct YouTube search URL\n    - 2\u20133 recommended videos (with titles + links) for each course\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n\n- Prioritize videos that are:\n  - Full lecture series or playlists\n  - From reputable channels (universities, well-known educators)\n- Filter by language (e.g., English only, or Urdu/Hindi allowed)\n\nReply with:\n\n1. The exact course names from your UMS dashboard  \n2. Any preferences:\n   - Language: (e.g., \u201cEnglish only\u201d / \u201cEnglish + Urdu\u201d)\n   - Level: (e.g., \u201cbeginner-friendly\u201d / \u201cadvanced OK\u201d)\n\nThen I\u2019ll generate a clean, organized list of YouTube links for each course.",

Open YouTube**\n   - Go to: `https://www.youtube.com/`\n\n   **b. Search with course-specific queries**\n   For each course, search something like:\n   - `\"<course title> <course code> IBA\"`, e.g.:\n     - `\"Corporate Finance FIN201 IBA\"`\n     - `\"Data Structures CS201 IBA\"`\n   - If nothing relevant shows, broaden the search:\n     - `\"<course title> full course\"`\n     - `\"<topic name> lecture\"`, e.g.:\n       - `\"Time value of money lecture\"`\n       - `\"Binary search trees tutorial\"`\n\n   **c. Open relevant videos**\n   - From the search results, open:\n     - Playlists that look like full course series.\n     - Videos whose titles closely match your course topics.\n   - Right-click \u2192 **Open link in new tab** (or middle-click) so you can keep the search page open while opening multiple videos.\n\n4. **Do this one-by-one for all courses**\n   - Go back to the UMS dashboard.\n   - For each course:\n     1.

Upload those images here.\n\nWith that, I can give you a more exact, step\u2011by\u2011step path like:\n\n- \u201cClick \u2018My Courses\u2019 in the top bar\u201d\n- \u201cIn the left menu, click \u2018Lecture Videos\u2019\u201d\n- \u201cScroll to Week 3 and click \u2018Lecture 3 \u2013 Video\u2019\u201d\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me the names of your subjects and what you see in the course menus (e.g., \u201cAnnouncements, Course Info, Content, Assignments, Zoom, Grades\u201d), I can map out the steps for each subject one by one.",
